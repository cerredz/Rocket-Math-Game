# Rocket-Math-Game
Wesbite that displays a game called Rocket Math; a series of math problems that have to be completed in a short amount of time.Includes a database of all users, leaderboard, and ranked system.

Some important things to note is that when a person registers they are inputted into a database using sql. The sql database only takes unique usernames, and an error will pop up if: 1) Somone tries to create an account with an already existing username. 2) They login with an incorrect username and password.

The frontend of this project was made using react, and the backend was made with node and express. To connect the two, I used axios to make get and post requests.

Languages, frameworks, and tools used for this project were: React, mySQL, Axios, Node, Express, Javascript, and CSS.
